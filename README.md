# Modular-Arithmetics
Cryptographic exercises in modular arithmetic, covering Shamir's Three-Pass Protocol, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and RSA encryption/decryption with Python solutions.

This project contains solutions for modular arithmetic problems, including:
- Shamir's Three-Pass Protocol
- The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
- RSA encryption and decryption

Each section contains code examples, explanations, and screenshots of the process.
